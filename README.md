You'll have to bring your own laptop. If you don't have Mathematica you will have to install the 30 day [trial version][trial] **before the course**. Trial versions for multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, OS X) are available [here][trial].

### Download and install the MASS Toolbox

1. Download the latest MASS Toolbox [here][toolbox]
2. Unpack the ZIP file (**the installation will not work otherwise!**)
3. Open the Installer.nb
4. Evaluate the first code block
5. Open a new Mathematica notebook and run ``<<Toolbox` `` to see if the installation worked (don't forget the backtick)

The installation procedure will put the package into platform dependent location. You can figure out this location by evaluating `$UserBaseDirectory`.
